# Neural Network Classification with PyTorch

This project demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a 5-layer fully connected neural network using PyTorch on the MNIST dataset. It also includes model visualization and can be extended to other datasets like FashionMNIST.

## Objectives

- Create and host a project on GitHub
- Build a 5-layer neural network for digit classification
- Train and evaluate the model using PyTorch in Google Colab
- Visualize predictions using Matplotlib
- Practice using a different dataset (FashionMNIST)
